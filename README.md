# The CPP good times

I worked with C/C++ between 2008 and 2010.  
This repository is my fresh start with the language after many years focused mainly on Python and JavaScript.  

The first challenge, of course, is getting back to the compiler mindset!

## Back to the Origins

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
